# Company QuickSearch Tool 

## What is it?

A simple app that speeds up the company research process. Fewer clicks, faster writeups! 

Researchers run multiple searches with similar terms: "*companyName founders*", "*companyName hq address*", "*companyName logo transparent background svg*". Time consuming! Annoying!

Here, users can type in the company name and use the buttons to run these searches instead.

## What features? 

* Each button is hard-coded with additional strings that are commonly used (for example, "*transparent background svg*"). Users swap out multiple keystrokes for a single click.
* The 'Logo', 'Favicon', and 'News' buttons will directly open the image or news results page. 
* There's a direct link to the site where users can remove image backgrounds.
