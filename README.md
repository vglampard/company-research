# Company QuickSearch Tool 

Simple app that speeds up the company research process. Fewer clicks, faster writeups! 

Instead of googling multiple different search terms for the same company, users can type in the copmany name and use the buttons to run these searches instead.

The search will automatically be run with any additional strings that are commonly used (hard-coded).

The 'Logo', 'Favicon', and 'News' buttons will directly open the image or news results page. 

For example, typing in 'CompanyName' and clicking 'Logo' will run a search for "CompanyName logo high resolution transparent background svg" and take users directly to the google image results page.

Clicking 'News' will run a search for "CompanyName news" and take users directly to the google news results page.
